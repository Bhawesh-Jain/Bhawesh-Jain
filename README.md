# 👋 Hi, I'm Bhawesh Jain

I'm a **self-taught full-stack developer** with 4+ years of experience building scalable products for the real world — especially in the **finance (NBFC)** and **B2B SaaS** space.

I work with **Next.js**, **Flutter**, **MySQL**, and a custom-designed API architecture to deliver platforms that handle **real money, real customers, and real complexity**.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🔧 Build **production-ready SaaS platforms** for lending, laundry services, field operations, and internal tooling
- 🧩 Design scalable APIs, workflows, and admin dashboards that businesses actually use
- 📱 Develop **cross-platform mobile apps** with Flutter — fast, native-feel, and integrated with live backends
- 🧠 Think in **product** terms — not just code. Understand what users and clients need

## 💡 My Edge

- 🧠 **Self-taught**: Learned by building — not by theory
- 💼 **Real-world delivery**: Not just side projects — these apps are live, used, and trusted
- 🛠️ **Indie mindset**: Can own product delivery end-to-end — from DB schema to UI polish
- ⚙️ Built custom rendering engines, dynamic content systems, modular APIs — when off-the-shelf wasn’t enough
