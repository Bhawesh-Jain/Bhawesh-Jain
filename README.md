### 🛠️ My Dev Story

- 📱 Started in Android using **Java/Kotlin**
- 🌐 Shifted to backend with **Node.js APIs**
- 🚀 Now building full-stack products with **Flutter + Next.js + SQL**
- 🧠 Self-taught — No bootcamps, no degrees. Just docs, bugs, and shipping.
- 🧪 I care about **clean architecture**, **scalability**, and **user-first design**

- 🧩 Design scalable APIs, workflows, and admin dashboards that businesses actually use
- 📱 Develop **cross-platform mobile apps** with Flutter — fast, native-feel, and integrated with live backends
- 🧠 Think in **product** terms — not just code. Understand what users and clients need

## 💡 My Edge

- 🧠 **Self-taught**: Learned by building — not by theory
- 💼 **Real-world delivery**: Not just side projects — these apps are live, used, and trusted
- 🛠️ **Indie mindset**: Can own product delivery end-to-end — from DB schema to UI polish
- ⚙️ Built custom rendering engines, dynamic content systems, modular APIs — when off-the-shelf wasn’t enough

### 🧩 Projects I’m Building

- 🏦 **Loan SaaS** — Approval engine, field app, EMI rules, multi-role dashboards  
- 📦 **ERP Core** — Custom block-based UI renderer (like Notion meets CRM)  
- 📲 **Inventory & Ops Mobile Tools** — Lightweight apps for real-world fieldwork
