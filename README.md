### My Dev Story

-  Started in Android using **Java/Kotlin**
-  Shifted to backend with **Node.js APIs**
-  Now building full-stack products with **Flutter + Next.js + SQL**
-  Self-taught — No bootcamps, no degrees. Just docs, bugs, and shipping.
-  I care about **clean architecture**, **scalability**, and **user-first design**

##  What I Do

-  Build **production-ready SaaS platforms** for lending, laundry services, field operations, and internal tooling
-  Design scalable APIs, workflows, and admin dashboards that businesses actually use
-  Develop **cross-platform mobile apps** with Flutter — fast, native-feel, and integrated with live backends
-  Think in **product** terms — not just code. Understand what users and clients need

##  Projects That Matter

###  Loan Management Platform
> Built for real NBFCs  
- **End-to-end lending flow**: Loan creation, credit scoring, approval workflows, property valuation
- Dynamic dashboards for admins, field officers, and management
- Partial prepayment, foreclosure, and EMI tracking
- Tech: **Next.js + MySQL + Custom API Layer**

###  Laundry & Dry Cleaning App (Flutter + Next.js)
> SaaS-style tool for service providers and end-users  
- QR-based provider discovery and service binding  
- Dynamic pricing per category (shirts, pants, etc.)
- Real-time order tracking, delivery assignment, and status updates

###  Dynamic Form Engine
> Admins create forms, users fill them on Android  
- Supports spinners, images, radio buttons, and text inputs  
- Data structure + rendering fully API-driven  
- Flutter frontend, Next.js backend

##  My Edge

-  **Self-taught**: Learned by building — not by theory
-  **Real-world delivery**: Not just side projects — these apps are live, used, and trusted
-  **Indie mindset**: Can own product delivery end-to-end — from DB schema to UI polish
-  Built custom rendering engines, dynamic content systems, modular APIs — when off-the-shelf wasn’t enough

###  Projects I’m Building

-  **Loan SaaS** — Approval engine, field app, EMI rules, multi-role dashboards  
-  **ERP Core** — Custom block-based UI renderer (like Notion meets CRM)  
-  **Inventory & Ops Mobile Tools** — Lightweight apps for real-world fieldwork
